namegen-haskell
===============

A name generator written in Haskell

obtaining data
==============

The name generator will be based on samples from different languages. It will generate new languages by considering mixed samples. The first activity should be therefore to obtain a list of existing names from different languages and in different categories (people names, city names, etc.). I plan to do that by runnign queries against DBPedia.
